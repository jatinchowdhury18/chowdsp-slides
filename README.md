# chowdsp-slides

`chowdsp-slides` in an experimental system for creating slideshow presentations. At the moment there's not much to see here, but check back later!

These slides use:
- [Visage](https://github.com/VitalAudio/visage) for graphics/UI
- [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) for audio playback
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) for web support
